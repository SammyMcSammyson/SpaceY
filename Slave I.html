        <p class="slave1text">Jango Fett stole Slave I whilst undertaking a job on Oovo IV, a prison moon that Firespray
            attack craft were used to guard, outfitting the craft with a number of weapons, including laser cannons,
            projectile launchers, and seismic charges. While under Jango's ownership, the ship was used to travel to
            Ord Mantell and in a dogfight over Geonosis against a Jedi starfighter piloted by Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br><br>


            After Jango's death during the First Battle of Geonosis, the craft came into the possession of his son,
            Boba, who used it throughout his failed quest to kill the Jedi Master who had beheaded his father, Mace
            Windu. Boba, his ally turned mentor Aurra Sing, Castas, and Bossk traveled to the planet Florrum to meet
            with Sing's friend, spice pirate Hondo Ohnaka in the ship. After the arrival of the Jedi Master Plo Koon and
            Padawan Ahsoka Tano, Fett and Bossk were captured. When Sing tried to escape on Slave I, Tano leaped onto
            the ship's hull and sliced off a wing with her lightsaber. After this, Sing lost control of the ship and it
            crashed, with the Jedi believing Sing to be dead. Ohnaka pulled her out of the crash siteand took ownership
            of Slave I for a short period of time, before it returned to Fett's ownership near the end of the Clone
            Wars.
