        <p class="falcontext">The Millennium Falcon, originally designated YT 492727ZED and formerly known as the
            Stellar Envoy, and
            registered or known under various aliases and pseudonyms including Broken Bell, Corell's Pride, Close Shave,
            Fickle Flyer, Foul Matter, Graphite Skipper, Jin-Den Smoke, Longshot, Lost and Found, Star Princess,
            Sunfighter Franchise, Sweet Suprise, Meetyl's Misery, Wayward Son, and Victory Ring, was a Corellian YT-1300
            light freighter built around 60 BBY. Earning a legendary status under their ownership, the ship was most
            famously used by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca before, during, and following the Galactic Civil War.
            <br><br>

            During the Falcon's time in the possession of the smuggler Lando Calrissian, it accumulated numerous
            modifications in the name of convenience and luxury, including painted exterior paneling and a large escape
            pod. However, during Han Solo's famous record-breaking Kessel Run, in which he piloted the freighter for the
            first time, many of these additions were destroyed or lost, leaving the ship battered by the time Solo won
            it from Calrissian shortly afterwards in a game of sabacc. Its aged appearance still belied numerous
            advanced modifications to boost the ship's speed, weapons, and shields, including a hyperdrive engine among
            the fastest in the entire galaxy, enabling it to outrun Imperial Star Destroyers. It also included
            sensor-proof smuggling compartments, which were used during the rescue of Princess Leia Organa in 0 BBY to
            evade Imperial stormtroopers. Afterwards, the Millennium Falcon saw further action when Solo chose to join
            the Rebel Alliance during the Battle of Yavin, where it was able to sneak up and fire on Darth Vader's TIE
            Advanced, allowing Luke Skywalker to fire the proton torpedoes from his T-65B X-wing starfighter that
            destroyed the Death Star.<br><br>

            After Solo was captured on Bespin, Calrissian took command of the Falcon once more to search for him. In 4
            ABY, following Solo's rescue, Calrissian flew the ship at the Battle of Endor, where it entered the DS-2
            Death Star II Mobile Battle Station and aided in its destruction from within. Over the next three decades,
            the ship fell out of Solo's hands and was stolen by a succession of criminals and thieves, ending up in the
            ownership of the trader Unkar Plutt on Jakku, a remote world in the Western Reaches. The Falcon was
            eventually stolen by the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey, former First Order stormtrooper Finn, and Resistance
            droid BB-8 to escape the forces of the First Order in 34 ABY. Shortly thereafter, it was reunited with Solo
            and Chewbacca.<br><br>

            Following Solo's death soon after, the Millennium Falcon became a Resistance vessel piloted by its new
            owner, Rey, throughout much of the First Order-Resistance War. In 35 ABY, the ship was once again captained
            by Calrissian during the Battle of Exegol, which saw a decisive victory for the Resistance and Jedi Order,
            before being returned to Rey, who had been newly dubbed a Skywalker.<br><br>
