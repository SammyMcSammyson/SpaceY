Reflection

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

&nbsp;&nbsp;YES
&nbsp;🎯 Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
&nbsp;&nbsp;YES
&nbsp;🎯 Ensure all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths.
&nbsp;&nbsp;YES
&nbsp;🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
NO
&nbsp;🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
&nbsp;&nbsp; I found placement difficult but practising alot helps.

Stretch Requirements
🏹 Create a "back to top" button. YES
🏹 Implement smooth scrolling for internal links to improve user experience. YES
🏹 Implement a hover effect on buttons to make them more interactive. YES
🏹 Create a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages. YES
🏹 Add a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads. NO - I have always hated this feature on websites and do not want to do it. Leave MySpace back in the 2000s.

🎯 What requirements did you achieve? Achived all requirements bar the music one however I imagine when I look back on this code in a few months I will laugh how uneeficient it is because I know that I have not done it at all in a efficient way.
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? Really struggled making my index page it does not look like how I want to to act and look however all my googling has hinted towards using JS to achive what I want rather than CSS will make my life easier. I will try it again next week. I also struggled making a back to the top button also stuggled making carasol swiper but will have a go next week to achive it.
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? See above

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission. If possible can you give me feedback on the efficiency of my code since I copied and pasted a lot of effects when I think I only needed to do it once and just apply it in different places.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)? Google, Stack Exchange and Youtube also several blogs/ forums on UI etc. One of the things I am going to look into is color thery and making a nice layout
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? Too many to list How did you solve them? Trial and error however a lot of my stuggles was with placement so adding a background color to the element helped visualise where everything is sitting.
What went really well and what could have gone better? Once i realised I need to have a notepad in fornt of me to doodle/plan etc. I found life went alot easier - I think thats why I was struggling with git since it is quite hard to visualise on paper what is happening - once I had a plan HTML and CSS is like lego just adding blocks to your instructions. I am really enjoying the problem solving aspect of it as well as many different soloutions to a problem.
