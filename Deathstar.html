        <p class="deathtext">The DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station, also designated as the DS-1 Orbital Battle
            Station and referred to as the Ultimate Weapon in early development stages and later as the Death Star I and
            the First Death Star, but simply referred to as the Death Star was a moon-sized, deep-space mobile battle
            station constructed by the Galactic Empire. It had been designed to fire a single planet-destroying
            superlaser powered by massive kyber crystals which would destroy any planet targeted. It was the pet project
            of Emperor Palpatine, Director Orson Callan Krennic, and its eventual commander Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to
            expound the military philosophy of the aptly named Tarkin Doctrine. <br><br>

            Some of the earliest plans for a mobile, planet-destroying superweapon dated back millennia to the ancient
            Sith. Thousands of years later, shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, the Geonosians, aligned with
            Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, designed the Ultimate Weapon in secret. After the
            fall of the Confederacy, construction of the Death Star was appropriated by the nascent Empire. It was built
            in orbit of Geonosis and supported by a complex logistical network of bases. The station, which took many
            years longer to complete than expected, was eventually moved from Geonosis to Scarif in its final stages of
            construction. <br><br>

            When the Alliance to Restore the Republic learned of the Death Star's existence, division emerged within
            Alliance leadership; some believed such a weapon too great a threat to justify continued insurrection and
            resistance, while others believed the Death Star was too great a threat to ignore, and must be destroyed.
            Ultimately, rogue operatives Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor led a mission, which the Rebel Alliance soon joined,
            to steal the battle station's design plans, as Erso had discovered that her father, who had been the primary
            engineer behind the project, had left a fatal flaw in the design, which could enable the Death Star to be
            destroyed with relative ease. <br><br>
