        <p class="sdtext">During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic Navy fielded a fleet of Venator-class Star
            Destroyers. The Venator-class saw action in numerous battles against the Confederacy navy including the
            Battle of Coruscant. Following the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, the Republic's
            Star Destroyers were incorporated into the new Imperial Navy. Aside from the Venator and Imperial-class
            Star Destroyers, other known models in Imperial service included the Victory and Secutor-class Star
            Destroyers.<br><br>

            During the rebellion and the Galactic Civil War, Imperial Star Destroyers took part in numerous engagements
            against the various rebel forces that eventually coalesced into the Alliance to Restore the
            Republic. Star Destroyers were deployed during the secret mission to Tatooine, Battle of
            Hoth, and the Battle of Endor. <br><br>


            Following the events at Endor, the Rebel Alliance's successor government, the New Republic, captured and
            destroyed numerous Star Destroyers in several engagements including the Battle of Theed, the Rebellion
            on Akiva, the Defense of Kuat, and the Liberation of Kashyyyk. By 5 ABY, Grand Admiral Rae
            Sloane estimated that 75% of the Imperial Star Destroyers before Endor had either been destroyed, captured,
            or lost in "confirmable if curious ways." While trawling through the archives at the Hall of Imperial
            Register on Coruscant, Sloane discovered that the remaining 25% had mysteriously disappeared and their
            purported destruction had been falsified.<br><br>
